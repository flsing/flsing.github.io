# My Personal Website


## Getting Started

This is the website I made in order to show what I have done. Feel free to bookmark the page in order to stay up to date with my activity and projects. I used a Bootstrap template and created the rest myself. April 2017


## Bugs and Issues

If you find any bugs or issues, please be free to send me a messege!

## Creator

The template I used was Start Bootstrap and was created by and is maintained by **[David Miller](http://davidmiller.io/)**
Start Bootstrap is based on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework created by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thorton](https://twitter.com/fat).
